# Grandma's Advice
Don’t look at the calendar. Just keep celebrating every day. 
Invest in quality pieces, they never go out of style. 
I make myself go out every day, even if it’s only to walk around the block. The key to staying young is to keep moving. 
Exercise, to me, is totally unnecessary. I think it’s mostly overrated. 
The use of vitamins? Forget it. And I don’t encourage going to a lot of doctors, either. 
Fall in love, get married. Sex is to be encouraged. 
Even if you feel hatred, keep it to yourself. Don’t hurt other people for any reason. 
Don’t ever give up on love. 
Nobody else controls you. 
Make time to cry.
Travel while you’re young and able. 
Don’t worry about the money, just make it work. Experience is far more valuable than money will ever be.
Don’t compare. You’ll never be happy with your life. The grass is always greener.
If you are embarrassed to be dating someone, you should not be dating them.
Do one thing each day that is just for you.
Don’t be a cheapskate.
Forgive.
Find your passion and live it.
Most time things will figure themselves out.
Choose the right parents.
Have a pet. Life gets lonely sometimes. Pets are reminders of how we’re all living things.
I’m not saying you have to practice one religion or another, or not practice one religion or another… I’m just saying that you should figure out what you believe in and live it completely.
Learn to adapt.
Take time to mourn what you’ve lost. 
Keep going and never give up. 
Make yourself walk. 
I drink the faucet water. 
Don’t just die all because you want to. 
Life is fun. It’s all up to the person. Be satisfied. You don’t have to be ‘happy’ all the time, you need to be satisfied. 
Love people. Find something to like about the person—it’s there—because we’re all just people. 
Get a great education. That is something that no one can take away from you. 
Think positive. 
Exercise every morning… I have a machine… it’s a cross between a rowing machine and a bicycle… [I do] 150, 200 [rows] every morning. I won’t leave my bedroom until I’ve done that. 
Be active. I do things my way, like skiing when I’m 100. Nobody else does that even if they have energy. And I try to eat pretty correctly and get exercise and fresh air and sunshine. 
If you’re positive you can get through it OK. When you think negatively, you’re putting poison on your body. Just smile. They say laughter is the best medicine there is. 
For years I would not take any medicines at all. I don’t think they do much, and lots of times the doctor is using you as a guinea pig. 
Don’t die too early. 
Just go ahead and do your thing no matter what. 
You can involve yourself in local problems. There are all sorts of things that have to be tended to in the world. 
Have lots of people in the house and lots of different kinds of people—young, old, black, white, people from all over the world. People have always energized me. 
Just keep going. 
I attribute my longevity to a great extent to walking, not being in the back of the car strapped down. 
I put my health down to whiskey and cigarettes. I only drink when I’m out, but my doctor said I wouldn’t be alive without them. I’m still alive, and I can lift my elbows—it’s great. 
There is no need to ever retire, but if one must, it should be a lot later than 65.  
To stay healthy always, take the stairs and carry your own stuff. I take two stairs at a time, to get my muscles moving.  
Pain is mysterious, and having fun is the best way to forget it. 
Don’t be crazy about amassing material things. Remember: you don’t know when your number is up, and you can’t take it with you to the next place. 
Science alone can’t help or cure people. 
Find a role model and aim to achieve even more than they could ever do. 
This is some advice for the ladies. Don’t marry an older man, marry a younger one. 
I try not to worry. I just try to live. 
I try to have enough trust and confidence in myself to deal with things as they come. 
I don’t eat very much, but I always eat a fruit, a vegetable, and a little meat, and always make sure that I get sardine and salmon at least once or twice a week. 
For less than seven years I had a mortgage. I paid everything outright, and I’ve lived that way until today. That is the secret to longevity right there. 
Keep busy doing what you like. 
You gotta have good genes. 
You gotta be… lucky for 100 years. 
Try not to eat anything that’s healthy. It’s true. I eat whatever I want. The secret to longevity is ice cream. 
Quit while you’re ahead. 
It’s just as important to take care of your mind. I take two classes… and I’ve studied everything from anti-Semitism to current events. 
[Humor is] a life force, a way of surviving the difficulties of living. 
When you laugh at yourself, you prevent others from laughing at you. 
I don’t care what you’re passionate about: maybe saving Dixie cup covers. But if you do it passionately, you’re alive. 
Age is not a disease. 
Don’t get hurt. 
Be honest. I’ve rarely lied. And when you are honest with people, it comes back to you, and they are honest with you. It’s too much work keeping up with a lie. You don’t need the extra stress. 
Keep an open mind, and things seem less strange. 
Always listen to the other person. You’ll learn something. Try to sit back, because you will learn a lot more listening to others than telling them what you know. 
You have to love what you do. if you find a job you love, you will never have to work a day in your life. 
Take naps every day. 
You get one family, so stick with them. But it depends if these hardships are financial or emotional or other types. Stick it out. Some days are worse than others, and you have to be ok with that. The night is darkest before dawn. 
I try to take the time to look at and appreciate the smaller things that make this life beautiful. When I do that, time slows. 
Do something interesting every day; otherwise you disintegrate. 
Learning new things makes you happy and keeps your mind active. 
Sleep well, try not to worry, and enjoy good dreams. 
Be lovable. I’ve lived a long life because there are so many people who love me. 
I take a drink of Scotch every day. And I feel great afterward. 
Keep kosher. 
I never drank, smoked, or fooled with the weeds, you know, that stuff. And I don’t let anything upset me, especially traffic. 
I don’t like stress. I can’t stand arguing. If anybody is fussing, I’m gone. I like to be around positive people, people who lift you up not bring you down. 
Mind your own business, and don’t eat junk food. 
Laughter keeps you healthy. You can survive by seeing the humor in everything. Thumb your nose at sadness; turn the tables on tragedy. You can’t laugh and be angry, you can’t laugh and feel sad, you can’t laugh and feel envious. 
Look inside your soul and find your tools. We all have tools and have to live with the help of them. I have two tools: my words and my images. I used my typewriter, computer, and my cameras to fight injustice. Whenever I see a possibility of helping people who are in danger, I want to help them. 
Have a good appetite, lots of friends, and keep busy. 
Have a good wife, two scotches a night, and be easygoing. 
Never run out of responsibility; if you don’t have one, find one. Find a cause and knock yourself out for it. It will enhance your brainpower, interest in life, and keep you alive longer. I’m alert because I work. Virtue is its own reward. 
It is very important to have a widespread curiosity about life. 
Keep yourself alert, active, and educated. Beat to your own drum.   
Don’t smoke, don’t drink, and don’t retire. 
Take one day at a time, and go along with the tide. 
You have to be lucky, but I made the best of things when bad things happened. I also ate prunes every single day. 
Do what you have to do. Don’t analyze it, just do it. 
Take it easy, enjoy life, what will be will be. Sleep well, have a Bailey’s Irish Cream before bed if you have a cold—you will wake up fine the next morning.
